                    When Jim Croce stepped on stage at Northwestern State University in Louisiana on September 20, 1973, he was riding a wave of long-overdue success. Over the prior year and a half, the 30-year-old singer/songwriter had gone from an opening act to the headliner. He had released two much-loved albums with a third, I Got A Name, due to come out in 10 days.
                    <br> <br>
                    Since the release of his ABC Records debut, You Don’t Mess Around With Jim, in early 1972, Croce had been working virtually non-stop. A surprise hit, the album produced three high-charting singles: the title track, "Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)," and “Time In A Bottle,” and his follow-up, 1973’s Life And Times yielded his first #1 hit, “Bad Bad Leroy Brown.”
                    <br> <br>
                    After his September 20th concert, Croce and his small crew, including guitarist and close friend Maury Muehleisen flew out of Natchitoches Airport on a chartered plane. Seconds after take-off, the plane crashed. No one survived.

                <h2>HIS MUSIC</h2>
                <p>Though Jim Croce was just 30 when he died, he packed a world of experience into his short-lived music career. When he wrote songs he kept it basic. Jim said, “There’s something about approaching universal truths with the simplicity of the acoustic guitar. You can take it anywhere and it helps me reach listeners of all ages and walks of life.”
                <br> <br>
                Jim Croce’s discography includes his work as a solo artist and as a duo with his wife Ingrid Croce and with his good friend, lead guitarist Maury Muheleisen.</p>
